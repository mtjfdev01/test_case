  },
  {
    question: "What artwork files do you need for this product page's SKU?",
    answer:
      "Send vector logos plus a layered file on our dieline, with bleed and safe zones. If you only have a brand kit, we can place it. Upload what you have with the quote and we will flag missing fonts, images, or barcode space.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I approve a structural blank or print proof before the full run?",

  art_card_boxes: [
    {
      question: "What is a folding carton, and when should a brand use one?",
      answer:
        "A folding carton is a printed paperboard pack — tuck ends, sleeves, and lock bottoms — often made on art card board for cosmetics, supplements, food gifts, and subscription SKUs. Brandsface specs folding cartons when you need sharp print and a retail-ready pack that still ships efficiently to US warehouses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which structure is better: tuck end, reverse tuck, or auto-lock bottom?",
      answer:
        "Straight tuck ends suit fast retail packing. Reverse tucks hide the thumb cut on the display face. Auto-lock bottoms hold more weight without tape. Share your fill line and product weight and we will pick the carton style that packs cleanly.",
    },
    {
      question: "What board weight should I spec for retail folding cartons?",
      answer:
        "Most product cartons land in a mid-to-heavy art card or SBS range so walls stay square on shelf. Heavier GSM reads more premium; lighter GSM cuts freight. Brandsface confirms caliper after we know your SKU size, window, and whether the carton must survive a mailer.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can folding cartons survive US e-commerce if they are not corrugated?",
      answer:
        "A folding carton is a primary pack, not a shipper. For DTC we usually nest the carton inside a corrugated mailer so print stays scuff-free. If you need a single-piece mailer, we will move you to corrugated instead of over-speccing paperboard.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which finishes work on custom folding cartons besides CMYK?",
      answer:
        "Foil, spot UV, emboss, soft-touch, matte or gloss lamination, and PET windows are common on art card folding cartons. We proof registration so foil and UV sit on the brand marks, not on scores. Tell us the unboxing moment you want and we will spec finishes that still machine well.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do folding cartons arrive assembled or as flat blanks?",
      answer:
        "Most folding cartons ship as flat blanks to save cube into the USA, then pop up on your packing line. Sleeves and some lock-bottom styles may need a different fold. Your quote states how they arrive so fulfillment can plan labor.",
    },
  ],
  rigid_boxes: [
    {
      question: "How is a rigid box different from a folding carton?",
      answer:
        "A rigid box is wrapped, thick board that does not collapse — magnetic closures, lift-off lids, and drawers. Folding cartons crease from a blank (often on art card board). Choose rigid when the unboxing has to feel like a gift; choose folding cartons when you need high-volume retail packs.",
    },
    {
      question: "When does a magnetic closure beat a lift-off lid or drawer?",
      answer:
        "Magnetic lids are fastest for gifting and influencer kits. Lift-off lids show a reveal when the cover comes off. Drawers control the reveal and hide the product until pulled. Brandsface recommends the closure from how the customer will open it, not from a catalog default.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you build foam, paper, or fabric inserts for jewelry and cosmetics?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We nest EVA, paperboard, or fabric-wrapped wells so bottles, compacts, and jewelry do not rattle. Send a sample or dimensions with your quote. Inserts are engineered with the wrap so the cavity and the lid close square.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are rigid boxes the right pack for beauty, jewelry, and electronics kits?",
      answer:
        "They are when perceived value and protection both matter — skincare sets, watches, earbuds, and PR kits. If you only need a printed sleeve around a product, a folding carton is usually leaner. We will not upsell rigid when a carton plus mailer is the better US-market spec.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can rigid boxes be wrapped in kraft, linen, or soft-touch paper?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Wrap stocks include coated, kraft, textured, and soft-touch papers, with optional foil or deboss on the lid. The wrap is what customers touch first, so we match it to the brand system used on your cartons and labels.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why do rigid boxes need more production planning than cartons?",
      answer:
        "Wrapping, magnets, inserts, and QC add steps after print. Artwork still must lock before that work starts. Plan rigid earlier than folding cartons, especially for US holiday and launch dates — your quote includes a production window after approval.",
    },
  ],
  corrugated_boxes: [
    {
      question: "Which flute should I choose for shipping: E, B, or C?",
      answer:
        "E-flute prints cleaner for retail-ready mailers. B-flute balances print and stacking. C-flute is for heavier or warehouse cartons. Brandsface matches flute to product weight, drop risk, and whether the box is seen by the customer or only by the carrier.",
    },
    {
      question: "When should I use a mailer instead of an RSC shipping box?",
      answer:
        "Use a mailer (often a roll-end tuck or similar) for single-SKU DTC so the customer opens a branded pack. Use an RSC when you are palletizing, mixing SKUs, or need fast tape-and-ship. Share your fulfillment method and we will spec the blank that packs on that line.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can custom corrugated boxes be printed in full color?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Short-run and premium work often uses litho-laminate or high-quality print on white liner; longer shipper runs may use flexo. We pick the print method from artwork, quantity, and whether the box is a brand moment or a brown shipper with a logo.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do I keep DIM weight down on US parcel mailers?",
      answer:
        "Right-size the blank to the product, cut unnecessary void, and avoid oversize flutes. Carriers bill the greater of actual and dimensional weight. We design corrugated mailers around your SKU so you are not paying to ship air to US addresses.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should the inside of a corrugated shipper be branded too?",
      answer:
        "Interior print pays off when unboxing is filmed or the mailer is the gift wrap. Skip it on bulk warehouse cartons. If you want a surprise inside, we can print a pattern or message on the inner liner without changing the outer shipper graphics.",
    },
    {
      question: "What makes a corrugated box retail-ready instead of warehouse-only?",
      answer:
        "Retail-ready packs use cleaner print, white or kraft that matches the brand, and structures that open into a tray or shelf-ready unit. Warehouse RSCs optimize compression and tape. Tell us if the box will sit on a US retail floor or only in a 3PL.",

  custom_pouches: [
    {
      question: "Stand-up, flat, or spout pouch — which format fits my fill line?",
      answer:
        "Stand-up pouches (doypacks) own shelf presence for snacks, coffee, and beauty refills. Flat three-side seals are lean for sachets and samples. Spout pouches fit liquids and squeezable formulas. Share how you fill — hopper, nozzle, or hand — and Brandsface will spec seals that run.",
    },
    {
      question: "What barrier film do I need for moisture, oxygen, or aroma?",
      answer:
        "Barrier depends on the product: coffee and nuts need aroma and oxygen control; powders need moisture holdout; cosmetics may need a different film stack. We spec matte, gloss, metallized, or clearer structures to the shelf-life target you give us — not a one-film default.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can pouches include a zipper, tear notch, valve, or hang hole?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Zippers for reopen, tear notches for first open, valves for degassing, hang holes or euro slots for pegs, and spouts for liquids. Features change seal zones, so we place them on the dieline before you spend on artwork.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are kraft or recyclable pouches an option for US CPG brands?",
      answer:
        "Where the product and supply chain allow, we can spec kraft-look or more recyclable structures. Barrier and recycle claims have to match the film, so we will not print an eco claim the pack cannot support. Tell us your sustainability target and category.",
    },
    {
      question: "How should pouch artwork and dielines be prepared?",
      answer:
        "Use the Brandsface dieline: vector brand marks, layered art, safe zones away from seals and zippers, and scannable barcodes. We review nutrition or INCI panels when they apply so type does not fall into the gusset on a US retail SKU.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will a custom pouch stand on a grocery or beauty shelf?",
      answer:
        "A stand-up pouch with a proper bottom gusset and fill volume will stand. Under-fill and it slumps; over-fill and seals stress. We size the pouch to your grams or milliliters so it faces shoppers, not the peg behind it.",
    },
  ],
  carry_bags: [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between paper, kraft, and luxury laminated carry bags?",
      answer:
        "Paper coated bags take crisp brand color for boutiques. Natural kraft reads eco and artisan. Laminated luxury bags add stiffness, gloss or matte, and heavier load for beauty and fashion. Brandsface matches the bag to the box family so checkout still looks like one brand.",
    },
    {
      question: "Which handle is strongest for retail checkout?",
      answer:
        "Twisted handles take more weight for apparel and multi-item baskets. Flat paper handles are lighter for cosmetics. Ribbon or rope handles are for gifting. We spec handle, patch, and board together so the bag does not tear at the US checkout counter.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can carry bags color-match my boxes and labels as one set?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We proof bags against the same brand palette as your cartons and tags so the shopping bag is not a near-miss. If you already have a rigid or folding carton job, send that standard and we will align the bag print.",
    },
    {
      question: "What bag size works for apparel versus cosmetics?",
      answer:
        "Apparel needs height and a wider gusset for folded garments. Cosmetics and jewelry use smaller, stiffer bags so bottles do not slump. Share the largest SKU you will bag and we will size to that, not to a generic template.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are paper shopping bags recyclable after checkout?",
      answer:
        "Unlaminated paper and kraft bags are typically easier to recycle in US curbside streams than heavy plastic laminates. If you need a recyclable story, we will avoid coatings that break that claim. Your quote can note the stock so marketing copy stays accurate.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do branded bags work for pop-ups and events as well as stores?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The same custom carry bag can run checkout, markets, and gifting if the handle load and print are specced for mixed use. Tell us whether bags stack in a stockroom or go in a touring kit so we can pick board and finish.",
    },
  ],
  kraft_boxes: [
    {
      question: "When should I choose kraft boxes instead of white folding cartons?",
      answer:
        "Choose kraft when the brand story is natural, artisan, or low-ink. White folding cartons on art card board are better for photographic print and high chroma. Many US organic and DTC brands use kraft as the hero pack and keep a coated carton for a premium SKU.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can kraft packaging look premium without going full-color?",
      answer:
        "Yes. One or two inks, black or white, a small foil, and a tight structure often look more expensive than flooding kraft with CMYK. Texture does the work. Brandsface will show a print approach that keeps the kraft visible.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are kraft mailers strong enough for e-commerce?",
      answer:
        "Kraft folding cartons are still primary packs. For parcels we often use a kraft-look corrugated mailer or nest the carton. If you want one brown box from pack-out to porch, we will spec flute and liner for that lane instead of stretching a light carton.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can kraft boxes take windows, sleeves, or simple inserts?",
      answer:
        "Windows, sleeves, and paper inserts work on kraft when the product should stay visible or cradled. We keep window film and ink choices aligned with your eco story so the pack does not contradict the brand.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do kraft boxes support an eco-positioned US brand?",
      answer:
        "Uncoated kraft signals recyclable and honest materials on US natural and e-commerce shelves. Claims still have to match the actual board and coatings. We will spec recycled content or FSC-aligned options when the supply chain supports them.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can kraft boxes be printed with one ink or with full-color graphics?",
      answer:
        "Both. Spot color on kraft is the classic look; full-color works when you need a photo or illustration. Ink coverage changes how brown shows through, so we proof on kraft — not on white — before you approve.",
    },
  ],
  labels_and_tags: [
    {
      question: "Should I order roll labels, sheet labels, or hang tags?",
      answer:
        "Rolls feed applicators and higher volume. Sheets are for short runs and hand apply. Hang tags and swing tickets tell the story on apparel and rigid boxes. Brandsface will match format to how you apply — line, 3PL, or in-house packing.",
    },
    {
      question: "What adhesive sticks to glass, PET, and kraft boxes?",
      answer:
        "Glass and PET need different tack than uncoated kraft, and cold-fill or condensation changes the spec. Share the container, wipe-down, and storage temperature. We pair face stock and adhesive so labels do not lift in US retail coolers or bathrooms.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can labels carry a barcode, QR code, or ingredient panel for US retail?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We keep barcodes and QR codes in high-contrast quiet zones and leave room for INCI or nutrition type. Send the latest legal copy with artwork so we are not squeezing required text after the dieline is locked.",
    },
    {
      question: "When do I need waterproof labels instead of paper?",
      answer:
        "Bottles that live in showers, fridges, or ice buckets need film or treated stocks. Dry cartons and hang tags can stay paper. If a paper label will scuff or wrinkle in use, we will move you to a durable face before you reprint.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do hang tags stay consistent with the rest of the pack?",
      answer:
        "We print tags on stocks and inks that match your boxes and bags — same palette, same foil if you use it. Hole, string, and fold are specced so the tag sits on the product the way the brand photos it.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you die-cut unusual label shapes for bottles and seals?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Custom contours, tamper seals, and nested kiss-cuts are common. Complex shapes affect rewind and apply, so we check the shape against your applicator or hand-apply method before cutting steel.",
    },
  ],
  "christmas-packaging": [
    {
      question: "When should US brands lock Christmas packaging for holiday shipping?",
      answer:
        "Treat Christmas as a dated launch, not a standard carton. Brandsface recommends locking structure and artwork early enough for proofs, foil, and ocean or air into US DCs before November peaks — often 8–12 weeks before your ship-by date, longer for rigid or matching sets.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can gift boxes, bags, wrap, and tags ship as one matching Christmas collection?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We color-match Christmas gift boxes, gift bags, wrapping paper, tags, and seals so retail and corporate kits look like one holiday line. Share the hero SKU first and we will extend the palette across the set.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are Christmas sweet and bakery boxes suitable for food gifts?",
      answer:
        "We can spec food-adjacent inks, grease-tolerant coatings, and windows for sweets, chocolates, and bakery gifts. Share the fill, whether it is wrapped, and the US region so coatings and windows match how the gift is packed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What Christmas packaging works for corporate gifting programs?",
      answer:
        "Rigid or sturdy art-card gift boxes, matching bags, and a seal or tag scale for client gifts. Keep structures simple so packing teams can assemble hundreds. We quote a kit — box, tissue or wrap, bag — instead of mixing unrelated holiday SKUs.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should holiday boxes use foil stamping or full-color print?",
      answer:
        "Foil reads festive on kraft and deep colors; full-color is better for illustrated scenes and photography. Many Brandsface Christmas packs combine a foil logo with CMYK art. We will not put foil on tight type that will break on the stamp.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Christmas folding carton styles convert to year-round gift packaging after December?",
      answer:
        "If the structure is a standard tuck, mailer, or bag, you can reprint without holiday graphics for Valentine's, launch kits, or evergreen gifting. Seasonal-only shapes should stay seasonal. Ask us to spec a dual-use folding carton if you want one blank and two artworks.",
